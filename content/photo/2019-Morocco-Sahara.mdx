Sahara Desert tour was our second time visiting a desert. (Last time was in Jordan). We boarded the shuttle from Merrakech, and we went eastward passing through the Atlas Mountain.

It took us 2 days to arrive Sahara. Everything, even the wind has left a trail on sand. Dunes are as tall as a mountain, which made us wonder how much wind it takes to move a dune.
