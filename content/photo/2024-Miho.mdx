After visiting [I. M. Pei: Life Is Architecture](https://www.mplus.org.hk/en/exhibitions/i-m-pei-life-is-architecture/) in 2024, I added Miho Museum to my itinerary for my trip same year to Kyoto and Osaka. Located in the mountains of Miho. It's a fascinating place to visit, and amazing to see how everything is designed to blend with the nature and season.
