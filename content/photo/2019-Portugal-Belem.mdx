Train Station, Footbridge, Art museum inside an old power station, Another museum about coach. Different pieces of architecture around Belem station, have formed a coherent modern architecture style. We walked along the promenade from Belem Tower to MAAT and discovered these sites one by one. They were built in different eras but they share the same vibe.
