Today is Portfolio Day and I want to share a recap of my personal website updates for the past year! Even though my work has mostly stay the same, my website has underwent small and incremental changes over the year.

## UX Career Kit


A few years ago, I created the [UX Career Kit](./resources/career) to assist designers in early career. I recently updated the list and added new resources to make it even more helpful. I have also integrated it into my website under the Resources section. Please feel free to share your thoughts and comments with me to help make it even better.

## Feed


Started a small experiment to create [my own feed](./feed). It would be a short-form content celebrating small wins, recap on community events, share personal updates. I'm using Airtable as a backend for easy access but also looking to new possibilities (Threads? or Post.cv?). For now, it will be a separate page, but I plan to integrate it with either the landing page or the About section.

## About & Uses Page 


Over the past years, I have made slight design adjustments to the [About](./about) and [Uses](./uses) pages on my website to ensure they are visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Howâ€™s ChatGPT has been helping?


ChatGPT has become viral in the past few months, and I want to delve into how it has helped sharpen my front-end coding skills. As a self-taught coder, I often find debugging to be a challenging process, involving extensive browsing on Stackoverflow.

However, ChatGPT has been a game-changer for me. It successfully debugged my Chakra UI tooltip issue (caused by a wrong z-index setting). Additionally, it managed to create a related posts query for my NextJS + [ContentLayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) based on a plain text explanation I provided within 2 prompts.

```js
  // Get up to 3 posts that share the same tag as the current post
  let relatedPosts = allPosts
    .filter((p) => {
      const hasSharedTag = p.tags.some((tag) => post.tags.includes(tag));
      return hasSharedTag && p.slug !== post.slug;
    })
    .sort((a, b) => {
      // Sort related posts by the order of the tags in the current post
      const aIndex = post.tags.findIndex((tag) => a.tags.includes(tag));
      const bIndex = post.tags.findIndex((tag) => b.tags.includes(tag));
      return aIndex - bIndex;
    })
    .slice(0, 2);

  // If no related posts found, then find posts in the same category
  if (relatedPosts.length === 0) {
    relatedPosts = allPosts
      .filter((p) => p.category === post.category && p.slug !== post.slug)
      .slice(0, 2);
  }

```


Moreover, integrating ChatGPT with VSCode has significantly improved my workflow. It helps me write commit messages and comments to explain my code, making the previously tedious tasks effortless.

The advancement of AI is focused on enhancing people's efficiency rather than replacing their work. We just need to find ways to integrate it into our workflows and continue learning.
