Hello JUXT friends,

It’s the end of the Q1 of 2022. Hope you have reserve some time to reflect on your progress so far. I treasure my blocked hour that I will spend on writing my own reflection. This month, I have joined [Friends of Figma, Hong Kong](https://friends.figma.com/hong-kong/) as one of the community moderator, we organized our first kick-off event this month and it’s so great to meet new friends and contribute to the design community.

Between blog, digital garden and [my resources bookmarks](https://juxtdesign.cc/resources/), I found it took quite a lot of time to maintain all 3 content pillars while keeping up with social media at the same time. Just wondering, how do you balance content and promotion when building a personal brand?

Best,
Samuel

I started a new collection called “Made in Hong Kong” this month, hoping to highlight some UX and design resources that are made in Hong Kong. Like my own Figma template “Keystroke”! Let me know if you know any resources!
