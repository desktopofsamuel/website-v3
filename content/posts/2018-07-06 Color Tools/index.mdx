Color is the combination of science and art, a simple color change could have drastic effect on the emotion or perception of the viewer. Being a UI/UX designer, mastering the color theory and its application truly can step up your design game.

Stephen Few’s [“Tapping the Power of Visual Perception”](https://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/ie/visual_perception.pdf) coined the term “Preattentive Attributes” in displaying data. Intensity and hue of color are two attributes that can enhance visual communication quickly. 

> Leveraging color help users to process information, prioritize what they have seen, subsequently convert into actions. 

<cite>Stephen Few</cite>

Same rule applies in designing social media graphics and user interfaces, using color intentionally reinforces the quality of design. Here are the best color tools you can use right now to create beautiful palettes and gradients for next design project.

## 1. Digital Color Meter (MacOS, Free)

The most convenient app to grab color code is the one built-in to your Mac. Digital Color Meter is the default Mac utilities app hidden in your Application folder. The app does one job great, capture color as you point your cursor. Simply press Shift + Command + C will copy the value into the clipboard. You can also adjust color profile (native, sRGB, Adobe RGB or P3 etc.) as well as the values to display (sRGB hex code for me). To be honest, this free app probably satisfies most people’s need in picking color.
