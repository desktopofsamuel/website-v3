Hello JUXT friends,

It’s a short month in February but it was quite productive for me. This month, I moved to explore the world of Tailwind CSS. Utility-first approach of Tailwind is quite interesting after trying out different styling solutions. I had also applied my learning immediately to my latest project.

I had the idea last year to convert part of the website into digital garden and I finally did it! There’s a sidebar in the Guides with a list of my quick note. Most of the code I re-used for a brand new starter in Gatsby, so every Obsidian user can publish their own Obsidian library as a website.

### ✨ LAUNCHING: Gatsby Starter Obsidian Garden✨

Obsidian currently offers Publish services ($20/month) with advance features. This starter is a free alternative for Obsidian users who want to publish their digital garden as a website. Obsidian can also serve as an on-device CMS to manage your content.
➡️ Check It Out
Best,
Samuel
