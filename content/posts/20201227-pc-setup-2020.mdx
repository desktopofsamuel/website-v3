Finally I have completed a PC build upgrade cycle. After 5 years, every part in my PC has been replaced. In retrospective, I have to say that I enjoyed the modular design of custom-build PC, which I am able to upgrade my own parts and spread off the cost in years, but it has its drawbacks. Comparing to owning a non-upgradable Macbook, both experience are unique that I am willing to invest on both sides.

Majority of task I perform on my computer are web browsing, design (using Figma), photo editing (using Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom) and gaming. 

My previous build was a second-hand purchase from work, it was used primarily for video editing, assembled by computer store in Sham Shui Po.

```
CPU: Intel Core i5-6400 @2.70GHz
MB: Gigabyte B150M-D3H MATX
RAM: Kingston 8GB DDR4 2133MHz x 2
SSD: A-DATA SP900 256GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD
HDD: WD PURPLE 2TB 3.5" SATA3 HDD
GPU: GeForce GTX 960 GAMING 2G
Case: Cooler Master Elite 361 Computer Case MATX
PSU: Sharkoon WPM500W Bronze
```
It was a decent budget build (around $790 including assembly and OEM Windows license), I know it sounds a lot less impressive now but I have proudly finished editing work for a feature-length documentary project back then. 

And now this is my new build:

```
CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 3600 3.6-4.2GHz (2020)
MB: Asus PRIME-P/CSM X570 (2020)
RAM: Corsair Vengenance Pro RGB 2x16GB 3200mHz
SSD: Intel 660p 1TB M2 SSD + A-DATA SP900 256GB 2.5" SATA3 SSD (2019)
HDD: WD Blue 3TB 3.5" SATA3 HDD + WD Enterprise 3TB 3.5" SATA3 HDD (2017)
GPU: GeForce Zotac GTX1070 (2018)
Case: Corsair Carbide 275R Black ATX (2019)
PSU: High Power Element Bronze 500W
```

Each of the component has been replaced over the years after buying the setup. Final piece of the build was actually the CPU and motherboard, after I experienced more lag after hooking up with a additional LG 4K 27" monitor. Also, I was unable to play the new Microsoft Flight Simulator properly due to heavy CPU usage. 

## From a Consumer To a Hobbyist

Over the years, I have learn more about PC parts and DIY by following Youtube channels and catching up with some news site. But the best lesson I have learned, actually was The Verge PC Build video, which I am little late about this matter.

When I was picking a motherboard, future compatibility certainly crossed my mind. Would I be able to use the same motherboard when I upgrade my next CPU in 5-7 years? It didn't work the last time, as my i5-6400 use LGA1151 while the latest 10th gen Intel CPU switched to LGA1200 instead. (And Ryzen is such a great deal in terms of price and performance). But next time, there could be another game-changing standard that everyone must hold on to, new standard like PCI-Express 4.0 and DDR5 and even USB 4 is expected to roll out in upcoming years.

My conclusion, it's certainly impossible to be future proof (at least in my 5-7 years scale). So in the end I just pick an affordable and acceptable option that has leeway for upgrades that I am aware of. 

## Next Upgrade

I have written most of this article before my last purchase - RAM. I didn't expect to upgrade my RAM as it was sufficient before. However, I have learnt that memory speed does affect CPU performance in AMD and I have been suffering lag & 100% RAM usage since motherboard and CPU upgrade (also after switched  to Firefox), so I have upgraded to Corsair Vengenance Pro RGB 2x16GB 3200mHz.

Now the cycle has finally completed and it would be safe for me to say I would not in need for an upgrade at least for a few years.
