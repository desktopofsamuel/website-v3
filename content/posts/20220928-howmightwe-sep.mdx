Hi Friends,

Thank you for those who joined “Do You Know Design Systems” early this month. It’s been a privilege to organise and host in-person event for the community. The night was enlightening covering all about design system. I have also added the deck as a resource below if you missed the event.

This month the biggest news in the design community probably was Adobe will be acquiring Figma. Even though everyone worried about Figma’s future, and Figma claimed to be autonomous and there’s isn’t a roadmap to integrate with Creative Cloud. But only time will tell if this acquisition is a good thing or not.

Samuel
