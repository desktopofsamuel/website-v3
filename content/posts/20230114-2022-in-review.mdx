As we bid farewell to the tumultuous year of 2022, it was a rollercoaster ride of both planned and unanticipated events. Amidst the ups and downs, I've set some goals for myself that I hope to achieve in the coming year.

## 1. Building Friends of Figma Hong Kong design communities

A exciting surprise for me this year was being a part of the Friends of Figma, Hong Kong community, where I got to meet new designers, friends and even future colleague! I set out the goal from last year without knowing how exactly to contribute more time to the design community. But luckily opportunities arose and I‚Äôm really grateful that I have been a part of Friends of Figma community.

We started small with virtual events and workshops in April, then we‚Äôve organised in-person events in the second half of the year as Hong Kong social-distancing policies have loosen. Now looking back, we have organised 20+ events in total this year! I have even had the chance to host a panel talk on Design System in September. Kudos to my fellow moderators Michelle, Joey and Arthur and everyone who have supported our communities along the way.

## 2. Getting a new job

In 2022, I embarked on a new journey by leaving my position as a consultant at HSBC and transitioning into a Product Design role for crypto exchange OKX. Although I came onboard during a challenging time in the crypto market, I relished the opportunity to work with a dynamic, fast-growing company that presented new and exciting challenges. I am grateful to be surrounded by a team of skilled and talented people who inspire me every day.

## 3. Read 12 books & Watch 20 documentaries

This year I was quite distracted from achieving my content consumption goals. I have only read 4 books (2 more to be completed very soon), and watched 6 documentaries only. Overall speaking, films watched has also a big drop from 94 to 53 films. But I have finalized my best picks,  check out my [Best of 2022 list](https://desktopofsamuel.com/best-of-2022#films)!

## 4. Running a (bi-)monthly newsletter

By the time this yearly review blog post has published, all my newsletters will be shut down as I was using a platform called [Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/) (acquired by Twitter, then shut down after Elon Musk‚Äôs acquisition). This year I set my goal to setup a newsletter every month. It's called ‚ÄúHow Might We‚Äù and in the end I've only written 6 issues. To me, it's not that different from writing a blog except easier to show previews & thumbnails of links that I've collected. If you're interested, feel free to check it on my blog under [Newsletter](./tags/newsletter) tag.

## 5. Improve my typing speed

As I got bored by the nearly same metrics every year (no. of books and documentaries consumed). To challenge myself, I have found something productive while easy to measurable and improve. A new goal for me in 2022 was to improve my typing speed.

Even though I have only spent my first half year on typing practice, my typing speed has increased from 66.3 to 82.2 wpm (23% increase). I have been solely relying on [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com/) to offer practices, tests and analysis on my typing profile. I have also developed a new interest in mechanical and custom firmware keyboard, hoping to further enhance my type speed and time to resolve tasks. I‚Äôm setting the target for 100 wpm in 2023.
