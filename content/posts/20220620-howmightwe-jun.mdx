Hello JUXT friends,

It’s been a while and I want to share what kept me so busy over the past few months.

As mentioned in my previous issue, I have become a community moderator for [Friends of Figma, Hong Kong](https://friends.figma.com/hong-kong/) and I have shifted my focus in running the community instead of contributing content to JUXT Design, which is a great thing as one of my key objectives was to involve in the design community in Hong Kong.

We are now active on [Discord with 200+ members](https://discord.com/invite/GAsmtRps6G) now after 2 months! We have already organised community events and workshops online. Our first [real-person event](https://friends.figma.com/events/details/figma-hong-kong-presents-fof-hk-summer-party/) is coming up on Jun 30, join us and let’s meet each other!


May is also a big month for Figma as big features dropped during the [Figma’s annual conference](https://config.figma.com/events/figma-config-2022/agenda) (all sessions are free to rewatch now), such as dark mode, component props and enhanced Auto Layout. These are very exciting news as Figma users and We have also hosting watching and rewatching party for design talks during the conference!

I’ve also written a [Medium article](https://medium.com/friends-of-figma-hong-kong/10%E5%80%8B%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8-figma-%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97-%E8%AE%93%E4%BD%A0%E7%9A%84%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88%E4%BA%8B%E5%8D%8A%E5%8A%9F%E5%80%8D-9eba59bafca6) last month about 10 Figma Tips to make your design process efficient.


Hopefully I will announce some more good news next month. Let’s stay in touch!

Best,
Samuel
