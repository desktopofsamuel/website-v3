Hello friends,

So here it goes, I started a new role as a product designer this month in a crypto company. Before starting a new role, I’m so grateful that I am able to take some time off, spent with family and friends. 

Never underestimate the power of a break, it helps you to reset, reflect and avoid career burnout in longer run. Having a break between 2 jobs are the best because the old company does not require your attentions anymore while you have not started in the new one, It’s just perfect for me. Therefore my takeaway is always negotiate your onboarding date, if the company really wants you to join, probably they can wait.

On the community side of things, July is freaking busy! Shortly after FoF Summer Party, UX Pear (another local UX community) also organised a in person event. This month I also hosted Designspiration, topic is the mighty [Portfolio and Personal Website](https://medium.com/friends-of-figma-hong-kong/tips-on-building-your-ux-design-portfolio-ed9ed159b18c)! There’s also a new experiment called “Side Project Saturday”, where we got to tour Goodnotes office (call out to the espresso machines on the right!) and work on our side project. 
Best,
Samuel
