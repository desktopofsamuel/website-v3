Welcome to 2024! As I embark on this new year, I find it important to take a moment to reflect on the past and the things that have brought me joy and fulfillment. 

## #Health

In 2023, I made a conscious effort to prioritize my health and physical activity. I started going to the gym at first but settled to learning tennis instead. 

## #Career

In terms of my career, I have accomplished a few notable things. I successfully completed IDEO U's certificate on Human-centered design and Activating Strategy. Additionally, I have become a mentor on ADPList and have completed 11 sessions with mentees from all over the world. ![](/static/2023-adplist-wrapped.png)

At my workplace, OKX, I am proud to have contributed to the Ethereum Shapella Upgrade as a Senior Product Designer. I even had the opportunity to share my role with university students during our very first Firm Visit in Hong Kong. I also took part in volunteering for the first time, teaching students at a local primary school about generative arts and NFT technology.

## #Community

In terms of my social life, I am a part of Friends of Figma in Hong Kong, and we have successfully organized two in-person events, fostering connections and collaborations within the design community.

## #Travel

One of the things I'm most grateful for this year is the resumption of travel as COVID restrictions ease and borders open. My wife and I were able to have our long-awaited honeymoon in Hawaii, exploring Oahu and Maui. It was an incredible experience, and we even had the chance to witness humpback whales in the wild for the first time.

Apart from our honeymoon, we also had the opportunity to travel to Okinawa (one of the tickets we obtained through a COVID plane ticket lucky draw), Beijing for work, and Tokyo & Izu to see Coldplay live for the second time. These trips added more unforgettable memories to our travel adventures.


## #Media

Every year I finish a old sci-fi tv show as they aren’t many good one these days. I have been watching Apple TV+’s Foundation but I got started on the original novel instead as I’m super interested in comparing the two. This year I have completed Issac Asimov’s sci-fi classic prequels (*[Prelude to Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation) and [Forward the Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation))*  as well as the original trilogy (*[Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Asimov_novel)), [Foundation and Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Empire), [Second Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation))*. I have read the original trilogy decades ago, but I’m still totally blown away it was written more than 70 years ago. I still have sequels to go but it has been a very fun journey catching up all the classics. 

This year I have watched 53 films in total. My stat for 2023 can be viewed on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/samuelisme/year/2022/).
