tldr: "Thoughts of Note-taking after reading Tiago Forte's Building A Second Brain"
---

Just finished reading “Building A Second Brain” by Tiago Forte, it’s a profound piece that makes me rethink on my note-taking tools & strategy. I’ve known Tiago Forte awhile ago to apply P.A.R.A organization method for Evernote but it wasn’t the time when everyone talked about personal knowledge management (PKM). Here’re 3 new mindsets that inspired me to change after reading Building A Second Brain:

## Rethinking how note-taking apps should work for me?

One big change after reading Building a Second Brain is treating note-taking app as a knowledge base instead of a software where you jot notes. When I was studying at school, regrettably there wasn’t any syllabus or curriculum on learning how to organize digital knowledge & information productively, But but my realization is it’s crucially important to learn how to deal with over-information, organize them and connect them in a way that is meaningful to myself.

Knowledge is fragmented these days, knowledge previously contained in a book is now distributed across multiple blog posts, youtube videos, podcasts or even reels. Consuming multimedia and distilling those information to become my own knowledge is a big step of change when we think about note-taking. (Kudos to Readwise Reader’s advance feature to watch saved videos & transcript at the same time to highlight)

Second brain will become my own reliable knowledge sources (instead of googling keywords every time as search algorithm could change overtime) and it will be faster & more productive, as I got all the content I need when I start a new project. I would save time on finding stuff and start processing it right away (Distill stage).

## Accessibility of notes: how we store notes & how to find them? 

Tags were amazing when I first used Evernote comparing to traditional tree-structured directories. However as time span, I forgot how I named the old tags and create new one instead. (Reading the bonus chapter on tagging system right now). At the same time, I followed what most note app recommended, notes were separated in basically two pools, “Inbox” and “Library”. Even if I able to process all incoming new notes, searching on a related topics would take multiple tries.

The book introduced an important concept, organise your notes not according to where you access the information but where are you going to use it. Instead of “Book Summary”, “Meeting notes” or “Inspiration” notebook, make the destination actionable so it will be easier to reach (e.g Build A Second Brain, Manage a successful team). Favor a structure that will tell you what exactly how to achieve certain tasks. I have also refined my primary goal of using note-taking app, to make knowledge and information as easily and frequently accessible, that’s what success look like for my project of building a second brain.

Of course, recategorizing my 1000+ notes require a lot of effort, therefore I start out from my inbox this month and hope to work my way back in time.

## No notes will ever be final

Notes should be activated at different timing (**C**ollect when you noticed it would be useful, **O**rganize when you have time to tag it or summarize it, **D**istill when you find it useful for a new project, **E**xpress it into your creation whether it's a writing, presentation or any work that you do). If not, it won’t be any different from physical notebooks that you put inside a box in storage unit, it would become a part of memory instead of your active brain.

The CODE method as I recognized, is also harnessing the power of Spaced Repetition, at least 4 occasions that you’ve activated your memory on the note, and it’s ever-changing. After the project end, it can be repurposed and reactivated in the future.

> It’s not natural for humans to completely reorganize their entire world all at once. There are too many layers, too many facets of a human life, to perfectly square every little detail.

<cite>Tiago Forte</cite>

Recognizing the fact that my note system will not settle, even my trials with new note-taking apps will be never-ending. The process of CODE ask for little time of mine to offload the information to the second brain. And I am confident that this will transform how I work with notes in the future and Even though I would like to learn more complicated setup, but I recognize one definite fact - less complicated and easier my setup is the more likely I would be successful.
