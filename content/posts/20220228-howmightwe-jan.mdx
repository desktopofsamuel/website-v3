Hello JUXT friends,

Welcome to the first issue of How Might We! Here I will be sharing more behind the scene & reflection while working on JUXT Design.

## Learn, Share & Advocate
First month of 2022, I have been busy learning and working on JUXT Design’s new website. I finished a NextJS course last month, which has finally encouraged me to experiment it with one of my website. It’s way faster, less opinionated yet more development effort for hobbyist like me.

I have also made new plans for JUXT Design this year, new content are being created! Notice the new domain? The website was also rewritten from scratch using the latest tech stack! I’m also switching to Revue for newsletter service. I’ll be sharing monthly on my recent work
Looking forward to share them with you,

Best,
Samuel
